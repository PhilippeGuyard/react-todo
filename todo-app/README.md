# Todo App

## Description

This Todo App is a simple yet functional application built using React and Material-UI (MUI). It was developed as a learning project to deepen understanding of React and to explore the capabilities of MUI. A significant focus during development was placed on implementing testing, using various libraries to ensure robustness and reliability. Writing tests was the most difficult part of the project, in part because of the way MUI renders components on the page. Testing is by no means comprehensive but it did help a lot to find issues with the app when developing.
